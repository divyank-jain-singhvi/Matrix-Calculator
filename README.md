# : Matrix Calculation: Graphical Matrix Calculator :
Matrix Calculator is a application where you can easily calculate the <b><ul><li>Matrix Addition</li> <li>Matrix Multiplication</li> <li>Matrix Subtraction</li> <li>Scalar Multiplication</li></ul></b> this calculator is used by python language. now there is a lot of large calculation in our project work and daily use of calculation so this Matrix calculator helps to calculate easily and decrease the time requirment to solve the problem.This calculator calculate the floating point number and and display the two point value after decimal

#  :Use of keys/button in this project :
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>KEY</th>
    <th>USAGE</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Must install tkinter liberary</b></td>
    <td><b>pip install tkinter<b/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TAB Key</td>
    <td>Go to the next block to write data</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Input Numeric/Floating Numbers</td>
    <td>Data Input</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a + A Button</td>
    <td>It gives a Addition of two matrix which we given as input</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a - A Button</td>
    <td>It gives a Subtraction of two matrix which we given as input</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a * A Button</td>
    <td>It gives a Multiplication of two matrix which we given as input</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>n-Input</td>
    <td>It takes a input for a scalar Multiplication</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Scalar Multiplication of n.a/td>
    <td>It give s a scalar multiplication of matrix of a using numeric value n</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
