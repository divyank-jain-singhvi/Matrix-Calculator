# : Matrix Calculation: Graphical Matrix Calculator :
Matrix Calculator is an application where you can easily calculate the <b><ul><li>Matrix Addition</li> <li>Matrix Multiplication</li> <li>Matrix Subtraction</li> <li>Scalar Multiplication</li></ul></b> this calculator is used by python language. now there is a lot of large calculation in our project work and daily use of calculation so this Matrix calculator helps to calculate easily and decrease the time requirement to solve the problem. This calculator calculates the floating point number and display the two-point value after decimal

#  :Use of keys/button in this project :
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>KEY</th>
    <th>USAGE</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Must install tkinter liberary</b></td>
    <td><b>pip install tkinter<b/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TAB Key</td>
    <td>Go to the next block to write data</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Input Numeric/Floating Numbers</td>
    <td>Data Input</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a + A Button</td>
    <td>It gives an Addition of two matrices which we given as input</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a - A Button</td>
    <td>It gives a Subtraction of two matrices which we given as input</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a * A Button</td>
    <td>It gives a Multiplication of two matrices which we given as input</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>n-Input</td>
    <td>It takes an input for a scalar Multiplication</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Scalar Multiplication of n.a/td>
    <td>It gives s a scalar multiplication of matrix of a using numeric value n</td>
  </tr>
 </table>

# Overview
Benefit of this project is to Make Calculation Easy to decrease the time taken to solve the complex problem of this program.So as we know the normal calculator in the system can't do MAtrix multiplication and we provide easy as pleasant to eye GUI Interface in this project
